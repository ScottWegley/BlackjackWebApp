# BlackJack Web App
This is a web-base app for playing BlackJack.  I took on this project to fill in my spare time during my first semester of freshman year.  I choose Blackjack becuase I enjoy it and thought it was a good way to reaffirm my experience with polymorphism, OOP, and data structures.  I chose to use TypeScript because I am fairly familiar with JavaScript and intimately familiar with Java, and TS seemed like a good way to marry my experiences.
