# BlackJack Web App
This is a web-based app for playing BlackJack.  I took on this project to fill in my spare time during my first semester of freshman year.  I chose Blackjack becuase I enjoy it and thought it was a good way to reaffirm my experience with polymorphism, OOP, and data structures.  I chose to use TypeScript because I am fairly familiar with JavaScript and intimately familiar with Java, and TS seemed like a good way to marry my experiences.

This was my first experience designing any sort of website/webapp that would be publicly hosted, as well as my first TypeScript projcet of any real depth.  While it was definitely a large workoad at the time, it was a good project for learning about hosting via GitHub pages as well as TypeScript.  One of the biggest flaws of this project, besides the truly horrendous UI, is the organization of the game.ts file.  I did not engage in best practice in terms of code layout, instead opting to just work with 700 lines of code.  Were I to redesign this project, I would place significantly more of an emphasis on modularity.

I did learn how to store session data through this project, which is an insecure solution but definitely interesting to know.
